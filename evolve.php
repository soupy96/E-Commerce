		Evolve is a true next-generation multiplayer shooter game featuring addictive adrenaline-pumping 4v1 action. One player-controlled Monster must evade and outsmart a team of four uniquely skilled playable Hunters. Evolve and overpower as the monster or team up and outnumber as the Hunters. With endless combinations of Hunters, Monsters, maps and game modes to choose from, no two hunts will ever be the same. It's survival of the fittest, and any side can win. Choose your side.
