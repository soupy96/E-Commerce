		With the Wii U GamePad the action can now flow seamlessly between the GamePad and the television, and it will open a new window into gaming worlds that can extend beyond the TV and completely surround you. It's intuitive and easy-to-use interfaces mean Wii U can be home to games for everyone in the family, from the latest games for the most avid gamer to fun and innovative new games for those looking for more casual pick-up and play experiences. Wii U extends beyond games with built-in wireless connectivity to get you online quickly and easily. Players with broadband Internet access will find new ways to connect with other players over the Internet in Miiverse, communicate in real time via the video chat feature with other friends and families, and access new downloadable games and additional game content from the Nintendo eShop. And the Wii U GamePad controller puts it all right at your fingertips.
